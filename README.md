# NYC Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
I am tasked with convincing investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, I useed Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
